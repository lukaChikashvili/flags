    suitor. Determined, Bichiko decides to kidnap Nani, but through a misunderstanding, he ends up kidnapping 
    her father instead. This leads to a series of comedic events that ultimately turn out well for Bichikoâ€”at

    Novelist Soso (Ramaz Giorgobiani) goes to his publishing house 
    in an attempt to find someone interested in publishing his latest manuscript. 
    The employees shuffle the author's manuscript around their office from person to person,
     but everyone seems to be too busy to actually read it. Soso ultimately discovers that the employees
      are wrapped up in anything but their direct duties and responsibilities so much that not even a giant 
      structural flaw in the building can get their attention. The movie is an allegory of Soviet-time 
      bureaucracy and Soviet system as a whole. At the end of the film, the house collapses and the employees
       move to another, brand new and modern building. 
    However, that does not mean they change their attitude towards their work ...
